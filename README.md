This repository contains two basic Python programs demonstrating recursive functions and mathematical operations using the `math` module.

#working of 1st program
The function factorial(n) calls itself recursively.
Base case: if n < 2, it returns 1.
Recursive case: it returns n * factorial(n-1).

#the Python program uses the built-in math module to perform three mathematical operations on a user-provided number. When the user enters any number (preferably positive), the program first calculates the square root of that number using sqrt(n). Then it finds the natural logarithm (log base e) using log(n). Lastly, it calculates the sine of the number in radians using sin(n). All results are printed on the screen. The math module is used because it provides ready-to-use mathematical functions for such operation
